# Hello World. 
This is my first blogpost so I thought I should introduce myself. I'm TC, also goes by the handle Qwerky. And... that's about all I can say before the mental gymnastics of trying to squeeze myself into an understandable label starts.

### Who am I?
I am a Chinese South African. In the simple sense. I was born in China and raised in South Africa. It's how I introduce myself to others which allows all parties to establish an initial common connection to refer back to for deeper talks in the future.

Over the years, I have felt more and more uncomfortable introducing myself this way. I was born in China where my parents instilled a sense of duty, community and hard work in me. I grew up in South Africa, the Rainbow Nation haunted by a divisive past, yet held together by a strong spirit of Ubuntu; I lived in the US and came to adopt their value of individualism and the belief of the self as a being of unlimited potential; I drifted to France and learned how to slow down and enjoy the people and ambiance; Through all this, I became a quilt that had one too many patches added on, to the point that I cannot identify the original patch. So whenever a round of introductions rolls around, I have the urge to say something like this:

Identity by a certain metric gives a sense of community but at the same time constrains us to a set of statements attached to that community. I have never quite fitted into an easy narrative. Instead, I learned to celebrate the journey that I have travelled and surround myself with a myraid of different communities which each reflect a little portion of me. Is it lonely? Perhaps. I certainly don't have the decade long friendships of those who never left the place they grew up have. But was it worth it? Absolutely, I feel immensely blessed to be able to have incorporated so many aspects of humanity and the world in my near 3 decades of life.

Hi, I'm TC. A hodge-podge of stories from around the world.
